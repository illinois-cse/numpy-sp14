{"name":"Scientific Python for Engineers","tagline":"Scientific Python for Engineers","body":"## A Short Course for Engineering Students\r\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages today.  NumPy, SciPy, and their affiliated ecosystem are used for advanced data processing and numerical computation for engineering applications.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the language and syntax through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to programming, nor is it intended to replace courses such as CS 101 which introduce programming concepts.  This course is strongly oriented towards practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter and does not cover the fundamentals of Python.\r\n\r\nExamples and applications will be of broad interest to engineers, and will attempt to exemplify good practices for general problem solving.  Our time constraints will not permit the in-depth motivation of the numerical methods selected for inclusion.  We recommend taking a numerical methods course or reading a good book on the subject if you would like the details and criteria of applicability of many of these methods.  (We warmly recommend [Acton](http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Methods-that-Work-Spectrum/dp/0883854503) or [Press _et al._](http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688) if you are in search of a text.)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n**EWS Workstation**:  Python is installed but is not up-to-date.\r\n\r\n* Open a command-line window.\r\n\r\n* Enter `module load canopy`.  Enter `canopy`.\r\n\r\n* Click on \"Package Manager\".  Click on \"Updates\".  Update `scipy` and `ipython`.\r\n\r\n* Close Canopy when you are done.\r\n\r\n* Test it by opening a command-line window and entering `ipython`.  If IPython loads, type `exit()`.\r\n\r\n**Own Machine, don't know if Python is installed**:\r\n\r\n* Install [Enthought Canopy Distribution](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), which is free for academic users.  (Make sure to get this license if you can.)\r\n\r\n* Test it by opening a command-line window and entering `ipython`.  If IPython loads, type `exit()`.\r\n\r\n**Own Machine, Python already installed**:  Presumably you know what you're doing with Python.  In this case, just be aware that we use recent versions of `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `mpmath`, and `timeit`.  We may even get to `pyflakes` or `pep8` and `autopep8` if there's time.\r\n\r\n* Test it by opening a command-line window and entering `ipython`.  If IPython loads, type `exit()`.\r\n\r\n**Everyone:**  Once Python and IPython are installed and working, follow these commands to be prepared for the workshop.\r\n\r\n* Download the [notebook]() to your Desktop folder.\r\n\r\n* Open a new command-line window and enter `cd Desktop`.\r\n\r\n* Input the following at the command line:  `ipython notebook material.ipynb &`.\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nCourse notes (IPython notebooks) are available in the ZIP file on this page.  You can execute this code by opening a command line window (Terminal.app on a Mac) and navigating to the directory where you decompressed the ZIP file.  In that folder, execute `ipython notebook` to start the IPython local server.  A browser window will open, allowing you to open and alter files.  (Shift+Enter executes the selected cell's code.)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n[Neal Davis](http://cse.illinois.edu/training) developed these materials for [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu).
